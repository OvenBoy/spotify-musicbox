# Spotify Music Box
The idea for this project is to create something similar to the [Spotify Car Thing](https://carthing.spotify.com/). It will use the [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk) to display the current streaming session. 

- A device to connect and display the now playing from a current spotify session
- Play/pause/track control
- Volume control to receiver (old hi-fi Panasonic)
